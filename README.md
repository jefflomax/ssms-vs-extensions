# SQLSynSugarAndValidation
The most interesting extension in this repo, SQLSynSugarAndValidation, is committed with the project unloaded, because at the moment access to a private repository is required to access the NuGet packages that make it work.  Stay tuned for this to become public, ping if it interests you.

Visual Studio 2022 support coming soon.

Enjoy,

Jeff
