INTERFACING .NET Standard 2.0
Visual Studio forces the binding redirect on assemblies in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe.config

So when you try to load a reference that is restricted by these binding redirects
or one that is dependent on an older DLL, the extension will fail.
This appears to be why using System.Text.Json is restricted, also
System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions is locked to 4.2.0.1
and
System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe is locked to 5.0.0.0
