ISSUES:
Still checking buffer size is exact

It seems of you create the results grid with select top 1000 from, it defaults
to including column headings

Paste as Values defaults to Horizontal, but large multi-column paste 
"D:\programs\TSQL\ExcelSingleColumnValuesPaste.txt"
only makes SENSE vertical.

IDEAS:

What about a DISTINCT paste?
